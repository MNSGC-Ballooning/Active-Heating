# Active-Heating

Code for Arduino-based active heater unit used for the MURI flights. The active heater unit described in HeaterV2.ino was successfully tested during GL122. Future modifications include: (1) replace analog sensor with a digital one; (2) integrate heater unit with the Arudino MEGA aboard the Tungsten cut payload (to reduce weight).
