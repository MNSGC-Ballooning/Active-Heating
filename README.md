# Active-Heating

Code for Arduino-based active heater unit used for the MURI flights. The active heater unit was operated using the code in HeaterV2.ino and was successfully tested during GL122. The unit includes an Arduino Uno, analog and digital temp sensors, SD logging shield, and heating pad (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11289). Future modifications include: (1) replace analog sensor with a digital one; (2) integrate heater unit with the Arudino MEGA aboard the Tungsten cut payload (to reduce weight).
