# Active-Heating

Code for Arduino-based active heater unit used for the MURI flights. An active heater unit, that includes an Arduino Uno, analog and digital temp sensors, SD logging shield, and heating pad (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11289), was operated using the code in HeaterV2.ino and was successfully tested during GL122. Future modifications include: (1) replace analog sensor with a digital one; (2) integrate heater unit with the Arudino MEGA aboard the Tungsten cut payload (to reduce weight).
